## Introduction

The Khandab Project, named in honor of the former head of security at the Computer Engineering campus of Amirkabir University of Technology,
aims to replicate the RFID-based door access control systems that were once in place.

Utilizing the RFID MFRC522 reader, our setup controls access to a secure door by reading RFID tags. Out of the two tags provided— ‘0cdb074999’ and ‘e3b2fa1ab1’— only one is granted entry permissions.
Access validation triggers a servo motor to simulate the locking and unlocking of the door, closely mimicking the mechanical action of an actual door control system.
